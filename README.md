# Desktop
A tool to automatically switch wallpapers in Windows 10.

This is a tool to switch desktop wallpapers automatically, depending on which virtual desktop you are on, 
and what orientation the desktop is in.
The program runs in the system tray, and relies on a config.ini file placed next to the executable.
It can automatically switch rainmeter configurations as well. If you don't need it, you can just leave it blank.

Only works on 64-bit Windows 10.

The program uses [VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor) with a custom header file.
